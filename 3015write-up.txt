* Which version Visual Studio and Operating System you used to test/write the code locally?

This project is written on windows 11 and visual studio 2022 version.

* How does it work? o How does your code fit together and how should a programmer navigate it

Simply open the visual studio project and then press F5 will run the project. For the code, I studied the implementation of [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) and create a camera class with some helper functions to capture mouse and keyboard movements to move the camera. For inverse engineering the code, check the `run(Scene & scene)` function in `scenerunner.h`, and then press F12 to check the implementations of each function.
